            <p>To be a good daughter, you'll need to show your parents that you love and respect them. There is no one
                way
                to do
                this since each family is different, but in general this means that you should listen to your parents,
                be
                responsible and help out around the house, and be open, honest, and kind. Whether you're trying to
                improve
                your
                relationship with your parents or hoping to make up for not being on your best behavior, being
                respectful is
                the
                best way to be a good daughter and show your parents how much they mean to you.</p>

                To Becoming a lawyer usually takes 7 years of full-time study after high schoolâ€”4 years of undergraduate
                study, followed by 3 years of law school. Most states and jurisdictions require lawyers to complete a
                Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA).
