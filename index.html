            <p>To be a good daughter, you'll need to show your parents that you love and respect them. There is no one
                way
                to do
                this since each family is different, but in general this means that you should listen to your parents,
                be
                responsible and help out around the house, and be open, honest, and kind. Whether you're trying to
                improve
                your
                relationship with your parents or hoping to make up for not being on your best behavior, being
                respectful is
                the
                best way to be a good daughter and show your parents how much they mean to you.</p>

            <h2>Music is my dream</h2>
            <p>
                Not only do I dream of songs I heard of before, but I hear improvised versions and sometimes entirely
                new songs. I sometimes have dreams where I'm playing on a piano while a song is on (usually the setting
                is in a party), and I destroy the keyboard with my skill. I'm not some advanced piano player, so I love
                those dreams because not only does it feel awesome that I'm actually playing a piano at such a level, or
                DJ-ing a crowd, but it just feels so real. The new songs don't pop up on some headphones I would be
                wearing, or some loud speakers. These songs come from me playing along in my dream.

                <h1>Advice from singer</h1>
                <h2 class="orange">2019 to present</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are someone who wants to commit to improving your singing voice, you must understand that the
                    process is far more than learning your lyrics or holding a tune. To learn how to sing for beginners,
                    most people end up taking voice lessons. Voice lessons are a wonderful way to have your voice,
                    posture, breath, and every other aspect of your voice examined.

                <p>
                    Having a good voice means having a good voice throughout a song, not just now and then. It means
                    having consistent volume, tone, pitching, support, and style at all times, and it will also help to
                    know what singing conditions are most conducive to consistent singing.
